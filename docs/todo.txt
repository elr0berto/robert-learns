resume drill - should it try to resume drill runs that refer to old versions of the drill with different card sets?

start creating real cards!

- consonant low/high pairs

style drill run page for mobile - make font size dynamic to fit screen?
drill everything EXCEPT. (for example all consonants except obsolote ones)

card-set-groups?

drills
- drill (card-sets & options?) - saved server side
- drill-run (drill & options?) - saved server side. can be resumed.
-- answers are saved server side, connected to drill-run. this keeps track of stats and of progress of the drill-run for resume.
-- when drill-run is deleted, answers are saved but with drillRunId = null. this enables stats for each card despite old drill runs themselves being deleted.


--- question, should drills or drill runs be connected to users? or to workspaces? or what?
--- maybe drill runs should be connected to users, and drills should be connected to workspaces?


Drill UI:
Button in the top menu "Drill"
- Button opens the drill page
- Modal has a dropdown with old drills and an option to create a new drill
- Dropdown has a button to create a new drill
- Initially only the dropdown is shown
- When an existing/old drill is selected, then under the dropdown the "edit mode" for that drill is displayed.
- When "create a new drill" is selected, then udner the dropdown the "create new drill mode" is displayed.
- in both edit and create mode you can select card-sets and options for the drill
- in both edit and create mode you can save the drill
- in both edit and create mode you can run the drill (running also saves)
- in both edit and create mode you can change the name of the drill

save stats for right/wrong answers
style card lists / cards -- maybe use CardGroup

lint everything
test creating workspaces
test editing workspace users
test different permissions are working
test creating cardsets
test creating cards

FUTURE: stop allowing unsigned in users to do anything?! OR create temporary session id's for them so that they can store drill runs etc...
FUTURE: different modals should have their own urls so that browser back button works
FUTURE: throw exceptions everywhere instead of "return UnexpectedError"?
FUTURE: uncaught exception should log all the same stuff as logWithRequest
FUTURE: clean up upload orphans
FUTURE: should be able to select additional card sets in the create card modal
