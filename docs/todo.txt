workspace users when editing workspace should be ordered by permissions and then self first
make front-page (show lists of workspaces?! or just "Welcome to robert-learns")
make workspace page show list of card sets
validation on every request in server
study-drill-session
save stats for right/wrong answers
style card lists / cards -- maybe use CardGroup

lint everything
test creating workspaces
test editing workspace users
test different permissions are working
test creating cardsets
test creating cards
test adding cards to other cardsets
test adding cards from other cardsets

FUTURE: different modals should have their own urls so that browser back button works
FUTURE: throw exceptions everywhere instead of "return UnexpectedError"?
FUTURE: uncaught exception should log all the same stuff as logWithRequest
