drills
- drill (card-sets & options?) - saved server side
- drill-run (drill & options?) - saved server side. can be resumed.
-- answers are saved server side, connected to drill-run. this keeps track of stats and of progress of the drill-run for resume.
-- when drill-run is deleted, answers are saved but with drillRunId = null. this enables stats for each card despite old drill runs themselves being delete.
