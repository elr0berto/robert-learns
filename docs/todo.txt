bugfix - edit workspace is crashing
make front-page (show lists of workspaces?! or just "Welcome to robert-learns")
add card to other card sets
centralize the permission stuff in shared
validation
security
logging
study-drill-session
save stats for right/wrong answers
style card lists / cards -- maybe use CardGroup
only show workspace-users to users that can edit the workspace
