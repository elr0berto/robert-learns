Who owns stuff? users or workspaces? If stuff belongs to a user, then other users that are admins for the same workspace cant see them.
But if they are owned by the workspace, then a user will have difficult sharing the item between multiple workspaces?
Both? Both users and workspaces? Media for example, is just media..
 no ownership in the media table (but record created by user?!) and then there's connections between media and workspace and media and users..


One item has text and/or graphics and/or audio
One itempair has two items
One homework has multiple itempairs
One lesson has multiple homeworks
One course has multiple lessons
One school has multiple courses
